### Hey, hey!

<h2> About me </h2>
<p> I'm Keegan A., an aspiring web designer. I'm currently a <u>second year student</u> at NAIT, pushing for my diploma in Web Design and Development. </p>

<p>I'm still working with the fundamentals of CSS, HTML and JS, but I've been dabbling in Tailwind and Bootstrap for school projects, as well as getting the basics of Wordpress.</p>

<p>Beyond the scope of Web Design, I'm an avid gamer. You can usually find me on games like Final Fantasy XIV, or just messing around in single-player RPGs.</p>
<p>I've got two dogs as well - both of them Pomeranians and both of them with incredible levels of 'Pom-itude'.</p>

<p>Web Design's always been something that's interested me since I was young - watching some of the 'souped up dramas' with their frantic keyboard typing, and seemingly putting out several lines of 'code'...<p>

<p>But after getting into the industry and being able to finally start practicing typing and coding effectively and efficiently, I'm glad it's nothing like some of those dramas out there. It feels pretty rewarding being able to type up your own code (even just Readme docs like these!) and being able to understand what's being presented to you</p>

<p>It's a long journey ahead, but I'm looking forward to growing and learning more about Front and Back-end development.</p>
