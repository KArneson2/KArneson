### Hey, hey!

<h2> About me </h2>
<p> I'm Keegan A., an aspiring web designer. I'm currently a second year student at NAIT, pushing for my diploma in Web Design and Development. </p>

<p>I'm still working with the fundamentals of CSS, HTML and JS, but I've been dabbling in Tailwind and Bootstrap for school projects.</p>

<p>Beyond the scope of Web Design, I'm an avid gamer. You can usually find me on games like Final Fantasy XIV, or just messing around in single-player RPGs.</p>
<p>I've got two dogs as well - both of them Pomeranians and both of them with incredible levels of 'Pom-itude'.</p>

<p>Web Design's always been something that's interested me since I was young - watching some of the 'souped up dramas' with their frantic keyboard typing, and seemingly putting out several lines of 'code'...<p>

<p>But after getting into the industry and being able to finally start practicing typing and coding effectively and efficiently, I'm glad it's nothing like some of those dramas out there.</p>
